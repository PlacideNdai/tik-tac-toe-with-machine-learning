How Beta Affects Learning and Playing in Tic Tac Toe AI


In this Tic Tac Toe game, the computer learns how to play using Q-learning, a type of machine learning.
One important part of this learning is the beta value.

 Beta controls how much the computer learns from each new game it plays. It is also called the learning rate.

If the beta is low (like 0.1)
, the computer learns slowly. It remembers old strategies more and only makes small changes after each game.
This can be good for stable learning, but it takes a long time for the computer to get better.

If the beta is high (like 1.0),
the computer learns quickly. It updates its strategy a lot after each game.
This helps it improve fast, but it may also forget good moves it learned earlier. It can become unstable and make mistakes.

A medium beta (like 0.5) gives a balance. The computer learns at a steady pace and keeps useful past knowledge.
 This usually leads to better and more reliable gameplay.
In training, a high beta helps the computer learn fast. But during real games, a medium or low beta is better for stable performance.
 Changing beta based on the situation can make the AI smarter and more fun to play with.
In short, the beta value affects how fast and how well the computer learns. Picking the right beta is important to make the AI strong and smart.
